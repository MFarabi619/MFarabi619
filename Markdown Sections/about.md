<summary><b>✨ About Me</b></summary>
<br/>

- 🌱 I began my self-taught developer journey in January 2023. I’m currently learning Full-Stack Web Development, and Automated Software Testing 🕸️🤖
- 👀 While I’m interested in web apps, I also have experience with lower level languages such as C/C++, and Java 🍵
- 💻 I'm also a passionate Vim/NeoVim enthusiast that enjoys task automation with Bash and Python 🥳
- 🛠️ I believe that a good developer experience (DX) is key to a good UI/UX. I regularly explore technologies and features that reduce fatigue and improve productivity 🚀
